# ConferenceTrackManagement

Conference Track Management:

This following solution uses a heuristic approach to provide one approximate solution:
For example, I calculated the No. Of Tracks Needed. It extracts the following input from the given input information:
It calculates the total no. of minutes available for talk on each track (180 minutes for morning session and 240 minutes for afternoon session). 
Total no. of minutes of talks needed to be schedule on these tracks. 
It calculates that how many morning and afternoon session required.
Based on the above it calculates the no. of tracks. It also picks talk one by one and schedule in a track and 
put into the Morning session or afternoon session without caring the left empty minutes in morning or afternoon session.
